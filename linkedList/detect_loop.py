# Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm:
# This algorithm allow us to dectec cycle in linked list. We will initiate two ponters at a time one twice fast as another and the if at any position both pointer equalize each other there is a loop. To find the starting point of the loop we will again initaite two pointer one from where both pointer collide each other and one from the head of the linked list, again the positon where both poninter meet each other is the begining of a loop in a linked list.
