This repository contains Data Structure and algorithms and their solutions using python language along refrence toward most useful blog articles and vedios.
Most of questions are solution of `How to crack the coding interview` along `Basic Algorithms and data Structure`.


### Basic Data Structure
- Strings and Array
- Queues and Stacks
- LinkedList
- Graphs and Trees

Basic algorithms and Data Structure to computer science problems:
- Fibonacci number series
- Knapsack problem
- Tower of Hanoi
- All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall
- Shortest path by Dijkstra
- Project scheduling


Most networking algorithms use the greedy approach. Here is a list of few of them:
- Travelling Salesman Problem
- Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Graph - Map Coloring
- Graph - Vertex Cover
- Knapsack Problem
- Job Scheduling Proble

The following computer algorithms are based on divide-and-conquer programming approach:
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
- Closest
