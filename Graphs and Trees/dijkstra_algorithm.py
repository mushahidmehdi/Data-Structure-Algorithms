# dijkstra is path finding algorithm which determines the shortest route or path between two nodes, given the cost value of each path.

# this algorithm used the idea of relaxation which means that
# d[u] + cost(u, v) = d[v]
# src--> u -- > v 

# Procedure to solve dijkstra alghorithm in python.
# 1) Create two sets shortest_path -- nodes withs shorest path from source to distination initially the shortest path will be False, and distance set -- keep track of Shortest route from source to destiney.

# 2) Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph.
# Initialize all distance vaules as infinite at the beggining bcoz any distance would be less than than inf. Assign distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that we can picked it first.

# 3) While shortest_path doesnâ€™t include all vertices => True: 
# Pick a vertex u which is not there in shortest_path and has minimum distance value, add u to shortest_path.
# Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if the sum of a distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v.
