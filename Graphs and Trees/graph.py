# GRAPHS:
# Graphs are networks consisting of nodes connected by edges or arcs. In directed graphs, the connections between nodes have a direction, and are called arcs; in undirected graphs, the connections have no direction and are called edges.
# https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/ 

# graphs are easily built in Python out of lists and dictionaries. For instance, here's a simple graph:
graph = {'A': ['B', 'C'],
		'B': ['C', 'D'],
		'C': ['D'],
		'D': ['C'],
		'E': ['F'],
		'F': ['C']
			}

class Graph:
	def __init__(self):
		self.nodes = set()
		self.arcs = defaultdict(list)
		self.distances = {}

	def add_node(self, node):
		self.nodes.add(node)

	def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node, distance):
		self.arcs[from_node].append(to_node)
		self.distances[(from_node, to_node)] = distance

# An adjacency matrix organizes the cost values of edges into rows and columns.
# First, we assign integer indices to our nodes making sure to start our indices at 0. (i.e. A=0, B=1, C=2â€¦).
# We then initialize an N by N array where N is the number of nodes in the graph. We will use NumPy array to build our matrix:
# adjacency_matrix_graph=np.zeros((n,n))
# For instance, element (0,1), corresponding to the number in row 0 column 	, should be filled with the cost value of the edge between nodes 1 and 2 which is 4. We can assign a 5 to element (0,2) with:
# adjacency_matrix_graph[0,2] =  5 (if we use numpy)
# adjacency_matrix_graph[0][1] = 4
